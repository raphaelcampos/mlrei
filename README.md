# MLREI: Machine Learning Reimplemented

The ideia is to reimplement machine learning methods in a didatic fashion, in order to have better undestanding of how the methods words.

All the code implemented here will be explained in my blog [Machine Learning Beyond Deep Learning](https://medium.com/machine-learning-beyond-deep-learning), which I created in order to share and spread my knowledge on machine learning in depth (from theory to practice) for a Portuguese-speaking audience.

## Motivation

Despite the name of the blog my objectives are the following:

- Produce and share excellent content about Machine Learning in Portuguese*
- Consolidate my knowledge on Machine Learning (I think that is no better way other than teaching and sharing to achieve that)

You can read a more detail explanation of my motivation [here](https://medium.com/machine-learning-beyond-deep-learning/machine-learning-beyond-deep-learning-a-motiva%C3%A7%C3%A3o-3548f83d8f81) (in Portuguese).

**Why in Portuguese? There are many good blogs and websites that produce excellent content in English, but there are few or almost none in Portuguese. Thus, I will focus on my country's audience because I believe that giving access to information and knowledge is the best way to change my country :).*

## Methods
the
So far, we implemented the following method:
